This is the fifth year of my PhD. student career in Electrical Engineering Department of National Tsing-Hua University. I'm from [Behavioral-Informatics & Interaction-Computation Lab (BIIC Lab)](https://biic.ee.nthu.edu.tw/) and my advisor is **Prof. Chi-Chun Lee**. Till now, I have proposed 15 papers in top conferences and journals, which include topics related to affective computing, AI research, speech signal processing, and language. Besides, I was involved in 4 industry projects, 2 research-related projects, and 1 internship experience in Disney Research, where some of them are cross-border cooperation. These experiences have made me a powerful developer, and a good collaborator.
