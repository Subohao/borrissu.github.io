Hi, I'm Bo Hao (Borris) Su, and I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University - Language Technologies Institute [WAV Lab](https://www.wavlab.org/) under the supervision of **Prof. Shinji Watanabe**. Besides, I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering Department of National Tsing-Hua University, [Behavioral-Informatics & Interaction-Computation Lab (BIIC Lab)](https://biic.ee.nthu.edu.tw/) and my advisor was **Prof. Chi-Chun Lee**. Till now, I have proposed 24 papers in top conferences and journals, which include topics related to affective computing, AI research, speech signal processing, and language. Besides, I was involved in 4 industry projects, 2 research-related projects, and 2 internship experiences in Disney Research and Amazon Web Service(AWS), where some of them are crossâ€‘border cooperation. These experiences have made me a powerful developer, and a good collaborator.
