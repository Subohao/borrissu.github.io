collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-08-30-Attribute-Aligned-Strategy
excerpt: 'To protect the privacy issue of end-users, we design a flexible attribute align strategy for distributing the information according to the pre-defined order. The overall architecture is implemented integrating the concept of dropout function and achieving the competitive results while considering the privacy compared to the SOTA.'

To protect the privacy issue of end-users, we design a flexible attribute align strategy for distributing the information according to the pre-defined order. The overall architecture is implemented integrating the concept of dropout function and achieving the competitive results while considering the privacy compared to the SOTA.
